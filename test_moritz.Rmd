## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


### Lets explore and understand our dataset more

**1.** What is the dimension of our dataset (i.e. how many rows/columns are there in our data)

```{r}
# Dimension
dim(prism)
```

```{r, results='hide'}
# Number of columns
ncol(prism)
# Number of rows
nrow(prism)
```

**2.** What are the column names of our dataset
The treatment names (columns names) represent the drug, the dose and the assay. For example, BRD-A00077618-236-07-6::0.0024414::HTS002 indicates treatment with the drug BRD-A00077618-236-07-6, with a dose of 2.4 nM, in assay HTS002. Values represent log fold changes with respect to a control DMSO experiment.

```{r}
colnames(prism[,1:10]) # Similarly rownames for rows
rownames(prism[1:10,])
```
