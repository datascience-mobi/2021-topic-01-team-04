\section{Introduction:}\label{introduction}}

Developing new drugs against certain diseases always is combined with
high costs, hard work and complicated requirements before even reaching
the market. Therefore an alternative approach of repurposing already
approved drugs to new diseases displays an attractive method to save
time and resources. On top of that by researching further with these
already licensed drugs most safety concerns can be eliminated, since the
medications have been thoroughly tested in previous investigations. All
in all the potential that drug repurposing possesses helps researchers
to create new therapy approaches without the excessive use of follow-up
investigations (Pushpakom et al., 2019).

In our research, we worked with multiple datasets that display among
other things the growth-inhibitory activity of 4518 different drugs
against 481 human cancer cell lines. Here we directed our attention
towards pancreatic cancer cell lines, of which there were 33 found in
the data provided (Corsello et al., 2020).

The most important datasets we focused on in our research were:\\
- the prism Dataset -\textgreater{} containing the treatment effects of
the different cell lines\\
- the prism.exp Dataset -\textgreater{} containing the gene expression
levels for every cell line gene\\
- the prism.achilles -\textgreater{} containing the gene knockdown score
for all cell line genes

The following questions we tried to answer over the course of our
research:\\
- can we identify certain genes that are related to pancreatic cell
lines\\
- can we determine treatments against these pancreatic cell line genes

\hypertarget{data-clean-up}{%
\section{Data Clean-up:}\label{data-clean-up}}

The first step in our research was to clean up the Datasets. This meant
to get rid of all N/A values that would interfere with our findings. The
prism.exp dataset did not contain any of these missing values, hence no
further clean up steps were necessary. The prism and the prism.achilles
dataset on the other hand did possess some N/A values. Here we

Afterwards we tried to visualize the given datasets to obtain a greater
knowledge about their distribution using different dicriptive
statistical methods.

\section{Using a statistical test to greatly reduce the number of genes
of
interest}\label{using-a-statistical-test-to-greatly-reduce-the-number-of-genes-of-interest}}

After basic data cleanup and evaluation of the data set prism.exp, which
contained expression data of the cell lines on genes, we were looking
for meaningful criteria with which to reduce the data set. It was clear
that our group should initially focus on the pancreatic cancer cell
lines. A reduction by pancreatic cell lines diminished the expression
data set from 477 to 33 rows. To achieve this, we first used the
metadata set prism.cl to get Depmap IDs, which are assigned to
pancreatic cancer. Since the row names of the prism.exp data set
received the Depmap ID's, we could cut the data set down.

In contrast, identifying interesting genes that are relevant to us
turned out to be more difficult. First, it had to be clear what exactly
was being searched for. Above all, the aim was to find genes that had
distinctive expressions. Such genes whose expression differed
significantly from other cancer cell lines. For such a task there are
competent methods in statistics, which were also discussed in our
bioinformatics lecture. With the help of statistical tests, it is
possible to test hypotheses between values of two cohorts and to
calculate a p-value, which represents a probability with which a
hypothesis can be rejected. For this reason, a corresponding H0
hypothesis was set up for the expression data, paying particular
attention to the mean values.

H0: ``The mean expression of gene X between pancreatic cancer cell lines
and non-pancreatic cancer cell lines is equal''\\
H1: ``The mean expression of gene X between pancreatic cancer cell lines
and non-pancreatic cancer cell lines is different''

One gene from the cohort of 33 pancreatic cancer cell lines and a cohort
of 33 randomly selected other cancer cell lines were examined for
significant deviations from the mean. Since we were using non-normalized
values, we had to use a non-parametric test. Furthermore, we are going
to use two-samples, which are unpaired. For that reason, we were using
the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. In this process, the values of the two
groups are combined and given a rank, whereby the information on group
membership is not lost. A test statistic is calculated from this, which
takes the sum of the ranks in a group into account. The result of the
test statistic is compared with critical values, the smaller the result,
the more significant the H0 hypothesis can be rejected.

First, in addition to the data frame, which contained cell lines and
genes, a data frame with the same number of genes in the same order but
with 33 other randomly selected cancer cell lines had to be made. A
prism.exp data frame was created for this, which did not contain any
pancreatic cancer cell lines. 33 cell lines were randomly selected from
this new data frame using the sample function. So, we got two cohorts.

33 values of a gene in one group were compared with 33 values of the
same gene in the other pancreatic cancer-free group using the Wilcoxon
rank sum test. That alone was not enough to find interesting genes. We
had to do the same with all 19177 genes in the data frame. So, a
multiple hypothesis test. For this reason, a for loop was used, which
took over the procedure column by column. For each gene, the calculated
p-value was put into a variable, so that in the end a variable with
19177 values was obtained. Now we can convert the p-values into Boolean
values, according to whether these values reach a given significance
level alpha or not. It must be noted that the significance level must be
adjusted in the case of multiple hypothesis tests, as otherwise the
results will be greatly changed by false positive values at high
implementation rates. We simply used the Bonferroni correction, whereby
the significance value alpha is divided by the number of times, in this
case 19177. Any NA values have been replaced by FALSE. This made it
possible to produce a vector that contained the names that were
significant. The colnames vector of one of the cohorts that had the same
sequence of gene names was used for that.

\includegraphics{Drug-sensitivity-in-cancer-cell-lines_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}
We can see in this distribution that there is a small group of genes
that regularly differs in the wilcoxon test. Therefore we can reject our
previously established H0 hypothesis.

\begin{verbatim}
##   interesting.genes Freq
## 1             AKAP4    1
## 2            AMIGO2    1
## 3              AMPH    1
## 4          ARHGEF18    1
## 5             ASAP1    1
## 6              ASPA    1
\end{verbatim}

The names of the top interesting genes can be viewed in this data frame.
Here for each gene is the number of times the H0 hypothesis was
discarded for this gene after carrying out onehundred.

\subsection{Setup and Initiation}\label{setup-and-initiation}}

First we remove all variables of the global environment and load in all
functions, data, and packages to be used. Furthermore, all data sets to
be used have their information void columns and rows removed. Then all
prism data is dose correlated, meaning that a drugs effect on cell
growth is normalised to the applied dosage (doscor). Morevover, this
doscor data is further processed, where the mean is taken of each drug's
effect per dosage (perdrug). All three---prism, prism.doscor, and
prism.perdrug---are then split each into a data set, containing only
data for pancreatic cancer cell lines and further into data sets, each
containing only cell lines of one of the four subtypes of pancreatic
cancer as identified in prism.treat. Now we want to identify the most
efficacious drugs in regards to their ability to inhabit cell growth per
applied dosage. we here extract the drugs above the 95th percentile for
each of the six data sets: prism.perdrug, pancan.perdrug, and the four
perdrug data frames for the four subtypes of pancreatic cancer.

Since the above graph exhibited a kink at i = 2 we chose to use two
clusters.

\begin{verbatim}
##              Length Class  Mode   
## cluster       33    -none- numeric
## centers      200    -none- numeric
## totss          1    -none- numeric
## withinss       2    -none- numeric

## iter           1    -none- numeric
## ifault         1    -none- numeric
\end{verbatim}

To further verify, that our choice of two clusters is the best choice,
we check which amount of clusters has the highest average silhouette
width. The result shows us that a clustering with two clusters is
optimal.

We extract all data regarding pancreatic cancer cell lines from the
prism.achilles data set. Then we extract information about the top 2
drugs in regard to their ability to inhibit cell growth. We then define
a fitted pancan.achilles data frame for each of the five drugs, that
contains only the cell lines where we have drug efficacy data and visa
versa.

We now set up our data upon which our linear regression will be based.

The data frame prism.achilles consists of gene knockdown scores. The
score is a measure of how essential/important is a particular gene for
the cell survival. This score reflects whether upon knocking down that
genes does the cell reduce its proliferation or increases it or has no
change. Smaller values refers to higher essentiality. The rows of this
matrix are the gene names and the columns are the cancer cell line
identifiers.
